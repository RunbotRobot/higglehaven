# higglehaven backend API

This document describes the current dev-only Cloudflare Worker + D1 API contract.
It is meant to keep backend and frontend work aligned while higglehaven moves
from browser `localStorage` placeholders toward persistent data.

## Scope and assumptions

- This API is intentionally **dev-only**: no auth, no payments, no multiplayer,
  no moderation, and no production seller/builder identity model yet.
- Internal names use plain `a` (`land`, `landlet`, `daller`) even when display
  copy may eventually use accented customer-facing strings.
- Coordinates and dimensions are decimal meters. Placed object positions use the
  current client convention: `x`/`y` are ground-plane coordinates and `z` is
  vertical.
- The Worker serves JSON under `/api/*` and falls back to Cloudflare static
  assets for all non-API routes.
- The default development landlet is `starter-landlet` until real land selection
  and builder ownership exist.

## Local and Cloudflare setup

The Worker expects a D1 binding named `DB` and an Assets binding named `ASSETS`.
Wrangler configuration lives in `wrangler.jsonc`.

```bash
npm run db:migrate:local
npm run db:migrate:remote
```

`db:migrate:remote` applies the migrations to the configured Cloudflare D1
instance. If a new D1 database is created, update the `database_id` in
`wrangler.jsonc` before deploying.

## Response conventions

Successful responses are JSON objects. Collection endpoints wrap arrays under a
plural key; single-record endpoints wrap the record under a singular key.

Errors use this shape:

```json
{
  "error": "Human-readable error message"
}
```

Malformed JSON and recognized D1 constraint failures are treated as client
errors rather than generic server failures. Duplicate resources return `409`,
foreign-key conflicts return `409`, and database check violations return `400`.
Raw SQL and internal D1 error details are never included in API responses.

The Worker currently sets permissive CORS headers for dev use.

## Health endpoint

### `GET /api/health`

Returns a simple health payload confirming that the Worker API route is live.

Response:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "service": "higglehaven-api"
}
```

## Catalog templates

Catalog templates describe product-like placeholders that can be placed into a
landlet. They are not production commerce listings yet.

### Catalog template object

```json
{
  "templateId": "placeholder-chair",
  "name": "Placeholder chair",
  "category": "placeholder",
  "subcategory": "furniture",
  "color": "#3366cc",
  "dimensions": {
    "width": 0.7,
    "depth": 0.7,
    "height": 1.0
  },
  "priceCents": null,
  "sellerId": "dev-seller",
  "modelUrl": null,
  "metadata": {
    "placeholder": true
  },
  "createdAt": "2026-07-29T07:30:06.519Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-07-29T07:30:06.519Z"
}
```

### `GET /api/catalog`

Lists catalog templates ordered by name.

Optional query parameters:

- `category`: filters templates by exact category.

Response:

```json
{
  "templates": [
    {
      "templateId": "placeholder-chair",
      "name": "Placeholder chair",
      "category": "placeholder",
      "subcategory": "furniture",
      "color": "#3366cc",
      "dimensions": {
        "width": 0.7,
        "depth": 0.7,
        "height": 1.0
      },
      "priceCents": null,
      "sellerId": "dev-seller",
      "modelUrl": null,
      "metadata": {
        "placeholder": true
      },
      "createdAt": "2026-07-29T07:30:06.519Z",
      "updatedAt": "2026-07-29T07:30:06.519Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### `GET /api/catalog/:templateId`

Fetches one catalog template.

### `POST /api/catalog`

Creates a catalog template. `templateId` is optional; if omitted, the Worker
generates one.

Request body:

```json
{
  "templateId": "placeholder-stool",
  "name": "Placeholder stool",
  "category": "placeholder",
  "subcategory": "furniture",
  "color": "#aa8844",
  "dimensions": {
    "width": 0.5,
    "depth": 0.5,
    "height": 0.6
  },
  "priceCents": null,
  "sellerId": "dev-seller",
  "modelUrl": null,
  "metadata": {
    "placeholder": true
  }
}
```

Required fields:

- `name`
- `color`
- `dimensions.width`
- `dimensions.depth`
- `dimensions.height`

All dimensions must be numbers greater than zero. `priceCents`, when present,
must be a non-negative integer.

### `PUT /api/catalog/:templateId`
### `PATCH /api/catalog/:templateId`

Updates a catalog template. The current implementation merges request fields
with the existing template before validation.

### `DELETE /api/catalog/:templateId`

Deletes a catalog template. D1 foreign-key behavior may reject deletion while
placed instances still reference the template.

Response:

```json
{
  "deleted": true
}
```

## World settings

World settings hold the dev-only singleton state needed to start modeling the
expanding circular world. This is not procedural world generation yet; it is the
small API surface that stores the values future generation code will consume.

### World object

```json
{
  "worldId": "default-world",
  "radiusM": 31.6227766017,
  "expansionIncrementM": 10,
  "greenbeltMinRatio": 0.1,
  "coordinateRotationDeg": 210,
  "dayCycleHours": 4,
  "landletCounts": {
    "total": 1,
    "greenbelt": 0,
    "claimed": 1,
    "generating": 0,
    "greenbeltRatio": 0
  },
  "metadata": {},
  "createdAt": "2026-07-29T07:30:06.519Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-07-29T07:30:06.519Z"
}
```

### `GET /api/world`

Fetches the singleton world settings object and aggregate landlet status counts.

### `PUT /api/world`
### `PATCH /api/world`

Updates world settings. The current implementation merges request fields with
the existing world settings before validation.

Request body example:

```json
{
  "radiusM": 41.6227766017,
  "expansionIncrementM": 10,
  "greenbeltMinRatio": 0.1,
  "coordinateRotationDeg": 210,
  "dayCycleHours": 4,
  "metadata": {
    "note": "dev-only world settings"
  }
}
```

Validation notes:

- `radiusM` must be zero or greater.
- `expansionIncrementM` and `dayCycleHours` must be greater than zero.
- `greenbeltMinRatio` must be between `0` and `1`.

### `POST /api/world/expand`

Expands the circular world boundary by exactly one configured
`expansionIncrementM` when the current greenbelt-to-total-landlet ratio is below
`greenbeltMinRatio`. If the reserve is already at or above the threshold, the
endpoint returns `409` and does not change the radius.

After expanding, generation-complete landlets that are fully enclosed by the
new circle become greenbelt and receive a `claimableAt` timestamp. Incomplete
landlets remain generating even when the boundary fully encloses them. Polygon
points are interpreted as plot-local meter coordinates relative to `center`.
For placeholder landlets without a polygon, the enclosure calculation uses a
same-area circle as a temporary approximation.

The same expansion also materializes queued land candidates the moment the new
circle first overlaps any part of their polygon. They enter the `generating`
state with no claimability timestamp; generation completion remains a separate
operation.

The response contains the updated world plus an expansion summary:

```json
{
  "expansion": {
    "previousRadiusM": 31.6227766017,
    "newRadiusM": 41.6227766017,
    "incrementM": 10,
    "promotedLandletIds": ["edge-candidate"],
    "startedGeneratingLandletIds": ["queued-edge-candidate"]
  }
}
```

## Land candidates

Land candidates are lightweight records for planned puzzle pieces outside the
current world boundary. They avoid creating full landlet records before those
pieces are needed.

### `GET /api/land-candidates`

Lists all candidates. `materializedAt` is null while a candidate is waiting and
is set once its landlet begins generating.

### `GET /api/land-candidates/:landletId`

Fetches one candidate or returns `404`.

### `POST /api/land-candidates`

Queues a candidate using the same `name`, `areaM2`, `center`, `landClass`,
`polygon`, and `metadata` fields as a landlet. If it already overlaps the
current world circle, the API immediately creates its generating landlet.
Otherwise it remains lightweight until a later expansion first overlaps it.

The `201` response contains both `candidate` and `landlet`; `landlet` is null
while the candidate remains queued.

## Landlets

Landlets are the first persistent world/plot records. They currently support
dev-only CRUD so future plot selection, greenbelt availability, and generation
state can build on a stable backend shape.

### Landlet object

```json
{
  "landletId": "starter-landlet",
  "name": "Starter landlet",
  "areaM2": 1000,
  "center": {
    "x": 0,
    "y": 0
  },
  "status": "claimed",
  "ownerBuilderId": null,
  "landClass": 1,
  "polygon": [],
  "generatedAt": null,
  "claimableAt": null,
  "activeVersionId": null,
  "metadata": {},
  "createdAt": "2026-07-29T07:30:06.519Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-07-29T07:30:06.519Z"
}
```

### `GET /api/landlets`

Lists landlets ordered by creation time.

Optional query parameters:

- `status`: filters by exact status (`greenbelt`, `claimed`, or `generating`).
- `ownerBuilderId`: filters by placeholder builder owner ID.

### `GET /api/landlets/:landletId`

Fetches one landlet.

### `POST /api/landlets`

Creates a landlet. `landletId` is optional; if omitted, the Worker generates
one.

Request body example:

```json
{
  "landletId": "dev-greenbelt-001",
  "name": "Dev greenbelt 001",
  "areaM2": 1000,
  "center": {
    "x": 20,
    "y": 0
  },
  "status": "greenbelt",
  "ownerBuilderId": null,
  "landClass": 1,
  "polygon": [
    { "x": -15.811, "y": -15.811 },
    { "x": 15.811, "y": -15.811 },
    { "x": 15.811, "y": 15.811 },
    { "x": -15.811, "y": 15.811 }
  ],
  "generatedAt": null,
  "claimableAt": null,
  "metadata": {}
}
```

Required fields:

- `name`
- `areaM2`

Validation notes:

- `areaM2` must be greater than zero.
- `center.x` and `center.y` default to `0` and must be finite numbers.
- `status` defaults to `greenbelt` and must be `greenbelt`, `claimed`, or
  `generating`.
- `landClass` defaults to `1` and must be a positive integer.
- `polygon` defaults to an empty array. When present, each point must contain
  finite `x` and `y` values in meters.

### `POST /api/landlets/:landletId/claim`

Claims an available greenbelt landlet for a builder. This is the preferred way
to perform the initial ownership transition instead of changing `status` and
`ownerBuilderId` independently with the generic update endpoint.

Request:

```json
{
  "builderId": "dev-builder-001"
}
```

The claim is a conditional database update: the landlet must still have
`status: "greenbelt"`, must have no owner, and the builder must not already own
a claimed landlet. This preserves the MVP rule that each builder can claim one
free starter landlet even when two requests arrive close together. A partial
unique D1 index also enforces this ownership rule for writes made through other
dev tooling.

Returns the newly claimed landlet. Errors are:

- `400` when `builderId` is absent or invalid.
- `404` when the landlet does not exist.
- `409` when the landlet is unavailable or the builder already owns a claimed
  landlet.

### `POST /api/landlets/:landletId/generation-complete`

Records that asynchronous generation work has completed. The endpoint is
idempotent: retries return the existing landlet once `generatedAt` is set.

Generation completion and geometric enclosure are independent requirements. If
the world circle already fully encloses the landlet, completion immediately
makes it greenbelt and claimable. Otherwise it remains `generating` with a
`generatedAt` timestamp until a later world expansion encloses it. Calling this
endpoint for a landlet that is neither generating nor already complete returns
`409`.

### `PUT /api/landlets/:landletId`
### `PATCH /api/landlets/:landletId`

Updates a landlet. The current implementation merges request fields with the
existing landlet before validation.

### `DELETE /api/landlets/:landletId`

Deletes a landlet. Current D1 foreign-key behavior cascades to placed instances
for that landlet.

Response:

```json
{
  "deleted": true
}
```

## Live landlet layout

### `GET /api/landlets/:landletId/live`

Returns the layout selected for the shopper-facing landlet without exposing the
builder's mutable draft. The response includes the landlet, a `published`
boolean, active version metadata, and the immutable snapshotted instances.

When no version has been activated yet, the endpoint still returns `200` with
`published: false`, `version: null`, and an empty `instances` array. Once a
version is active, draft edits do not affect this response until the builder
explicitly activates another saved version.

```json
{
  "published": true,
  "version": {
    "versionId": "7f49dfe8-3a5d-4a40-8d0e-a8fabfbddc92",
    "versionNumber": 1,
    "name": "Tree by the entrance",
    "instanceCount": 1
  },
  "instances": [
    {
      "instanceId": "versioned-tree",
      "templateId": "placeholder-tree",
      "x": 3,
      "y": 4,
      "z": 0,
      "rotationZ": 0.5
    }
  ]
}
```

## Landlet drafts

The draft endpoints provide a landlet-scoped alternative to issuing one request
per placed instance. They operate on the same mutable `placed_instances` rows
used by the individual instance CRUD endpoints.

### `GET /api/landlets/:landletId/draft`

Returns all mutable draft instances for the landlet.

### `PUT /api/landlets/:landletId/draft`

Atomically replaces the complete mutable draft. The request body is:

```json
{
  "versionName": "Initial furnished draft",
  "versionMetadata": {},
  "instances": [
    {
      "instanceId": "draft-tree",
      "templateId": "placeholder-tree",
      "x": 1,
      "y": 2,
      "z": 0,
      "rotationZ": 0.25
    }
  ]
}
```

`landletId` values supplied on individual entries are ignored in favor of the
route landlet. Instance IDs must be unique within the request, and a request may
contain at most 250 instances. An empty array clears the draft. D1 applies the
draft replacement and immutable version snapshot as one batch, so a validation
or foreign-key failure leaves both the previous draft and version history
intact. `versionName` and `versionMetadata` are optional; the default name is
`Version N`.

Every successful save creates a version, including a save with an empty array.
The response contains both the replacement `instances` and new `version`
metadata. SQLite JSON expansion inserts the validated instance array in one
statement, keeping the complete draft-and-snapshot save to four D1 statements
regardless of draft size for free-tier efficiency.

Individual instance CRUD calls remain low-level editing operations; this draft
replacement endpoint is the explicit save boundary that guarantees version
history.

## Landlet versions

Landlet versions are immutable snapshots of a landlet's placed instances. The
mutable `placed_instances` rows remain the builder's current draft, while a
landlet's `activeVersionId` points at the snapshot intended for shoppers.

### `GET /api/landlets/:landletId/versions`

Lists snapshot metadata newest-first. Each record includes `versionId`,
`versionNumber`, `name`, `instanceCount`, `metadata`, and `createdAt`.

### `POST /api/landlets/:landletId/versions`

Saves the landlet's current placed instances as a new immutable snapshot.
`name` and `metadata` are optional; omitted names default to `Version N`.

```json
{
  "name": "Tree by the entrance",
  "metadata": {}
}
```

Returns `201` with the newly created version metadata.

Version numbers are allocated inside the same atomic D1 batch that creates the
snapshot. Concurrent saves for one landlet therefore receive distinct,
sequential numbers rather than racing on a number calculated by an earlier
standalone read.

### `GET /api/landlets/:landletId/versions/:versionId`

Returns version metadata plus its snapshotted `instances` array. Later edits or
deletions in the mutable draft do not alter this array.

### `POST /api/landlets/:landletId/versions/:versionId/activate`

Moves the landlet's active-version pointer to an existing snapshot belonging to
that landlet. This endpoint does not overwrite the builder's current draft.
The response includes both the updated landlet and selected version metadata.

## Placed instances

Placed instances represent objects placed into a landlet from catalog templates.
Their response shape intentionally includes both `instanceId` and `id` so the
frontend can bridge from the original localStorage instance shape during the
migration.

### Placed instance object

```json
{
  "instanceId": "2ddc1202-30d5-48fe-9ba3-8a8a7d9d9c8a",
  "id": "2ddc1202-30d5-48fe-9ba3-8a8a7d9d9c8a",
  "landletId": "starter-landlet",
  "templateId": "placeholder-tree",
  "x": 1.25,
  "y": -2.0,
  "z": 0.0,
  "rotationZ": 0.5,
  "label": null,
  "createdAt": "2026-07-29T07:30:06.519Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-07-29T07:30:06.519Z"
}
```

### `GET /api/instances`

Lists placed instances for one landlet.

Optional query parameters:

- `landletId`: filters instances by landlet. Defaults to `starter-landlet`.

Response:

```json
{
  "instances": [
    {
      "instanceId": "2ddc1202-30d5-48fe-9ba3-8a8a7d9d9c8a",
      "id": "2ddc1202-30d5-48fe-9ba3-8a8a7d9d9c8a",
      "landletId": "starter-landlet",
      "templateId": "placeholder-tree",
      "x": 1.25,
      "y": -2.0,
      "z": 0.0,
      "rotationZ": 0.5,
      "label": null,
      "createdAt": "2026-07-29T07:30:06.519Z",
      "updatedAt": "2026-07-29T07:30:06.519Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### `GET /api/instances/:instanceId`

Fetches one placed instance.

### `POST /api/instances`

Creates a placed instance. `instanceId`/`id` is optional; if omitted, the Worker
generates one. `landletId` defaults to `starter-landlet`.

Request body:

```json
{
  "landletId": "starter-landlet",
  "templateId": "placeholder-tree",
  "x": 1.25,
  "y": -2.0,
  "z": 0.0,
  "rotationZ": 0.5,
  "label": null
}
```

Required fields:

- `templateId`
- `x`
- `y`

`z` defaults to `0`. `rotationZ` defaults to `0`. Position and rotation fields
must be finite numbers.

### `PUT /api/instances/:instanceId`
### `PATCH /api/instances/:instanceId`

Updates a placed instance. The current implementation merges request fields
with the existing instance before validation.

### `DELETE /api/instances/:instanceId`

Deletes a placed instance.

Response:

```json
{
  "deleted": true
}
```

## D1 schema overview

The migrations currently create seven main backend tables:

- `catalog_templates`: placeholder product templates and minimum product
  metadata.
- `landlets`: dev landlet records, including greenbelt/claimed/generating
  status, class, polygon metadata, generation timestamps, and placeholder
  owner IDs.
- `placed_instances`: objects placed into a landlet from catalog templates.
- `world_settings`: singleton dev world settings for circular expansion and
  shared world constants.
- `landlet_versions`: immutable layout snapshot metadata.
- `version_instances`: instance transforms captured within each snapshot.
- `landlet_candidates`: lightweight planned plots awaiting first circle overlap.

Indexes currently support category filtering, placed-instance lookups by
landlet/template, landlet status/owner/position lookups, and the one-claimed-
landlet-per-builder rule.

Seed data includes:

- `starter-landlet`
- `placeholder-table`
- `placeholder-chair`
- `placeholder-tree`

## Frontend integration notes

- The current API already matches the frontend's Z-up placement convention via
  `x`, `y`, `z`, and `rotationZ` response fields.
- `id` is returned alongside `instanceId` on placed instances for compatibility
  with existing local instance handling.
- Frontend code should treat backend persistence as the source of truth once the
  API is available, with any offline/local fallback kept intentionally separate.
- Future auth should not be inferred from this API. All endpoints are currently
  open by design for dev-only MVP work.

## Custom model uploads (not covered above)

Two additional routes exist outside the CRUD endpoints described above, added
to support builder-uploaded photogrammetry/scanned models rather than only
the built-in catalog:

- `POST /api/models` — accepts a `.glb` file as `multipart/form-data` (field
  name `file`), validates it (glTF 2.0 header, declared file length, chunk
  boundaries, required JSON metadata chunk, a 20MB hard size cap,
  and a live application-level 8GB total-R2-storage cap), stores it in the
  `MODELS` R2 bucket under a random `models/<uuid>.glb` key, and returns
  `{ modelUrl, sourceName, sizeBytes }`. The returned `modelUrl` is then used
  as-is in a normal `POST /api/catalog` call to register the product — upload
  and catalog registration are two independent steps.
- `GET /uploads/:key` — serves a previously-uploaded model's bytes back out of
  R2 (not the `ASSETS` static bundle, since only the built-in models ship as
  build assets). Responses are cached indefinitely (`immutable`) since upload
  keys are never reused.

Both require an R2 binding named `MODELS` (see `wrangler.jsonc`).

### Placed-instance tilt (`rotationX` / `rotationY`)

`placed_instances` (and its snapshot mirror `version_instances`, added by the
landlet-versions migration) carry `rotationX`/`rotationY` alongside
`rotationZ`, persisted as `rotation_x_rad`/`rotation_y_rad` columns. These
exist because real scanned models aren't guaranteed to come in level/upright
(the frontend's rotate gizmo allows tilting on all three axes to correct
this), unlike the built-in placeholder catalog which is always axis-aligned.
Collision math (client-side) deliberately still only reads `rotationZ` — see
`src/main.js`'s `footprintCorners` — so a tilted item's on-ground footprint is
approximated as its untilted bounding rectangle; this is an accepted
simplification, not an oversight, since 3D OBB collision isn't implemented.

## Automated tests

Run the Worker integration suite with:

```sh
npm test
```

The suite runs the Worker in Cloudflare's local Workers runtime, applies all D1
migrations to isolated test storage, and exercises the complete backend
lifecycle. Focused unit tests also cover world-circle geometry independently of
D1. Test storage does not modify the local development D1 state.

## Known gaps / future backend work

- Add procedural puzzle-piece generation to populate land candidates; circle
  overlap and materialization are already handled by the backend lifecycle.
- Add auth/trust/payment/account concepts only after the single-player dev
  backend is stable; they are intentionally out of scope now.
